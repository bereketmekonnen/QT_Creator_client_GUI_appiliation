# QT_Creator_client_server_GUI_appiliation

This is a server (camera_in) client (Final_assignment) C++ program that utilizes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection-oriented communications protocol that facilitates the exchange of messages between computing devices in a network to send instructions from the client (Final_assignment) to the serve (camera_in). The server program utilizes OpenCv to capture image data from the on board camera found on the DE10 standard FPGA board. The instructions recived from the client are used by the server to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image data.
